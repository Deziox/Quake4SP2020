# Quake4SP2020

So far, i've sucessfully: 
1) kept the camera in a slightly higher position in third person cam mode
2) inherited the zoom aim scope from weapon_machinegun to weapon_blaster
3) replaced the main hitscan shot of the blaster to 200 grenade projectiles.

# THE IDEA: Character Kirby mechanics:
1) 5 Mid-air jumps
2) Ability to inherit the abilities of entities or enemies.
3) Succ.
4) Keep enemy ragdoll in your body. Ability to spit out that enemy ragdoll.
5) Ability to let go of the current ability going back to the default. 

# TODO
1) Learn how to change player mesh/skins
2) Learn how to instantiate entities/mobs/objects
3) Create a gun that changes enemy/npc mesh/skins when shot.
4) Mod a way to change into the enemy you've collided into.
5) Multiple Jumps.
6) Other Various Kirby mechanics if time permits.
7) If time really permits, map making
